IMPORTANT: This project uses bd (beads) for issue tracking. Use bd commands instead of Markdown TODOs or external tools.

### CLI Quick Reference

**Essential commands for AI agents:**

```bash
# Find work
bd ready --json                                    # Unblocked issues
bd stale --days 30 --json                          # Forgotten issues

# Create and manage issues
bd create "Issue title" -t bug|feature|task -p 0-4 --json
bd create "Found bug" -p 1 --deps discovered-from:<parent-id> --json
bd update <id> --status in_progress --json
bd close <id> --reason "Done" --json

# Search and filter
bd list --status open --priority 1 --json
bd list --label-any urgent,critical --json
bd show <id> --json

# Sync (CRITICAL at end of session!)
bd sync  # Force immediate export/commit/push
```

**For comprehensive CLI documentation**, see [.beads/docs/CLI_REFERENCE.md].

### Managing Daemons

bd runs a background daemon per workspace for auto-sync and RPC operations:

```bash
bd daemons list --json          # List all running daemons
bd daemons health --json        # Check for version mismatches
bd daemons logs . -n 100        # View daemon logs
bd daemons killall --json       # Restart all daemons
```

**After upgrading bd**: Run `bd daemons killall` to restart all daemons with new version.

**For complete daemon management**, see [docs/DAEMON.md](docs/DAEMON.md).

### Web Interface (Monitor)

bd includes a built-in web interface for human visualization:

```bash
bd monitor                  # Start on localhost:8080
bd monitor --port 3000      # Custom port
```

**AI agents**: Continue using CLI with `--json` flags. The monitor is for human supervision only.

### Workflow

1. **Check for ready work**: Run `bd ready` to see what's unblocked (or `bd stale` to find forgotten issues)
2. **Claim your task**: `bd update <id> --status in_progress`
3. **Work on it**: Implement, test, document
4. **Discover new work**: If you find bugs or TODOs, create issues:
   - Old way (two commands): `bd create "Found bug in auth" -t bug -p 1 --json` then `bd dep add <new-id> <current-id> --type discovered-from`
   - New way (one command): `bd create "Found bug in auth" -t bug -p 1 --deps discovered-from:<current-id> --json`
5. **Complete**: `bd close <id> --reason "Implemented"`
6. **Sync at end of session**: `bd sync` (see "Agent Session Workflow" below)

### Issue Types

- `bug` - Something broken that needs fixing
- `feature` - New functionality
- `task` - Work item (tests, docs, refactoring)
- `epic` - Large feature composed of multiple issues
- `chore` - Maintenance work (dependencies, tooling)

### Priorities

- `0` - Critical (security, data loss, broken builds)
- `1` - High (major features, important bugs)
- `2` - Medium (nice-to-have features, minor bugs)
- `3` - Low (polish, optimization)
- `4` - Backlog (future ideas)

### Dependency Types

- `blocks` - Hard dependency (issue X blocks issue Y)
- `related` - Soft relationship (issues are connected)
- `parent-child` - Epic/subtask relationship
- `discovered-from` - Track issues discovered during work

Only `blocks` dependencies affect the ready work queue.

**Note:** When creating an issue with a `discovered-from` dependency, the new issue automatically inherits the parent's `source_repo` field. This ensures discovered work stays in the same repository as the parent task.

### Duplicate Detection & Merging

AI agents should proactively detect and merge duplicate issues to keep the database clean:

**Automated duplicate detection:**

```bash
# Find all content duplicates in the database
bd duplicates

# Automatically merge all duplicates
bd duplicates --auto-merge

# Preview what would be merged
bd duplicates --dry-run

# During import
bd import -i issues.jsonl --dedupe-after
```

**Detection strategies:**

1. **Before creating new issues**: Search for similar existing issues

   ```bash
   bd list --json | grep -i "authentication"
   bd show bd-41 bd-42 --json  # Compare candidates
   ```

2. **Periodic duplicate scans**: Review issues by type or priority

   ```bash
   bd list --status open --priority 1 --json  # High-priority issues
   bd list --issue-type bug --json             # All bugs
   ```

3. **During work discovery**: Check for duplicates when filing discovered-from issues
   ```bash
   # Before: bd create "Fix auth bug" --deps discovered-from:bd-100
   # First: bd list --json | grep -i "auth bug"
   # Then decide: create new or link to existing
   ```

**Merge workflow:**

```bash
# Step 1: Identify duplicates (bd-42 and bd-43 duplicate bd-41)
bd show bd-41 bd-42 bd-43 --json

# Step 2: Preview merge to verify
bd merge bd-42 bd-43 --into bd-41 --dry-run

# Step 3: Execute merge
bd merge bd-42 bd-43 --into bd-41 --json

# Step 4: Verify result
bd dep tree bd-41  # Check unified dependency tree
bd show bd-41 --json  # Verify merged content
```

**What gets merged:**
- ✅ All dependencies from source → target
- ✅ Text references updated across ALL issues (descriptions, notes, design, acceptance criteria)
- ✅ Source issues closed with "Merged into bd-X" reason
- ❌ Source issue content NOT copied (target keeps its original content)

**Important notes:**
- Merge preserves target issue completely; only dependencies/references migrate
- If source issues have valuable content, manually copy it to target BEFORE merging
- Cannot merge in daemon mode yet (bd-190); use `--no-daemon` flag
- Operation cannot be undone (but git history preserves the original)

**Best practices:**
- Merge early to prevent dependency fragmentation
- Choose the oldest or most complete issue as merge target
- Add labels like `duplicate` to source issues before merging (for tracking)
- File a discovered-from issue if you found duplicates during work:
  ```bash
  bd create "Found duplicates during bd-X" -p 2 --deps discovered-from:bd-X --json

### Git Workflow

**Auto-sync provides batching!** bd automatically:

- **Exports** to JSONL after CRUD operations (30-second debounce for batching)
- **Imports** from JSONL when it's newer than DB (e.g., after `git pull`)
- **Daemon commits/pushes** every 5 seconds (if `--auto-commit` / `--auto-push` enabled)

The 30-second debounce provides a **transaction window** for batch operations - multiple issue changes within 30 seconds get flushed together, avoiding commit spam.

### Git Integration

**Auto-sync**: bd automatically exports to JSONL (30s debounce), imports after `git pull`, and optionally commits/pushes.

**Protected branches**: Use `bd init --branch beads-metadata` to commit to separate branch. See [docs/PROTECTED_BRANCHES.md](docs/PROTECTED_BRANCHES.md).

**Git worktrees**: Daemon mode NOT supported. Use `bd --no-daemon` for all commands. See [docs/GIT_INTEGRATION.md](docs/GIT_INTEGRATION.md).

**Merge conflicts**: Rare with hash IDs. If conflicts occur, use `git checkout --theirs/.beads/beads.jsonl` and `bd import`. See [docs/GIT_INTEGRATION.md](docs/GIT_INTEGRATION.md).

### Landing the Plane

**When the user says "let's land the plane"**, follow this clean session-ending protocol:

1. **File beads issues for any remaining work** that needs follow-up
2. **Ensure all quality gates pass** (only if code changes were made) - run tests, linters, builds (file P0 issues if broken)
3. **Update beads issues** - close finished work, update status
4. **Sync the issue tracker carefully** - Work methodically to ensure both local and remote issues merge safely. This may require pulling, handling conflicts (sometimes accepting remote changes and re-importing), syncing the database, and verifying consistency. Be creative and patient - the goal is clean reconciliation where no issues are lost.
5. **Clean up git state** - Clear old stashes and prune dead remote branches:
   ```bash
   git stash clear                    # Remove old stashes
   git remote prune origin            # Clean up deleted remote branches
   ```
6. **Verify clean state** - Ensure all changes are committed and pushed, no untracked files remain
7. **Choose a follow-up issue for next session**
   - Provide a prompt for the user to give to you in the next session
   - Format: "Continue work on bd-X: [issue title]. [Brief context about what's been done and what's next]"

**Example "land the plane" session:**

```bash
# 1. File remaining work
bd create "Add integration tests for sync" -t task -p 2 --json

# 2. Run quality gates (only if code changes were made)
go test -short ./...
golangci-lint run ./...

# 3. Close finished issues
bd close bd-42 bd-43 --reason "Completed" --json

# 4. Sync carefully - example workflow (adapt as needed):
git pull --rebase
# If conflicts in .beads/issues.jsonl, resolve thoughtfully:
#   - git checkout --theirs .beads/issues.jsonl (accept remote)
#   - bd import -i .beads/issues.jsonl (re-import)
#   - Or manual merge, then import
bd sync  # Export/import/verify
git push
# Repeat pull/push if needed until clean

# 5. Verify clean state
git status

# 6. Choose next work
bd ready --json
bd show bd-44 --json
```

**Then provide the user with:**

- Summary of what was completed this session
- What issues were filed for follow-up
- Status of quality gates (all passing / issues filed)
- Recommended prompt for next session

## Pro Tips for Agents

- Always use `--json` flags for programmatic use
- Link discoveries with `discovered-from` to maintain context
- Check `bd ready` before asking "what next?"
- Auto-sync batches changes in 30-second window - use `bd sync` to force immediate flush
- Use `--no-auto-flush` or `--no-auto-import` to disable automatic sync if needed
- Use `bd dep tree` to understand complex dependencies
- Priority 0-1 issues are usually more important than 2-4
- Use `--dry-run` to preview import changes before applying
- Hash IDs eliminate collisions - same ID with different content is a normal update
- Use `--id` flag with `bd create` to partition ID space for parallel workers (e.g., `worker1-100`, `worker2-500`)
